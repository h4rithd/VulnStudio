By exploiting this vulnerability, attackers could potentially gain system access, including remote access to the affected machine.","remediation":"- Escape or prefix dangerous characters (=, +, -, @) with a single quote (') or other neutral characters before writing to CSV.\n- Use libraries or frameworks that handle CSV formatting securely, and avoid manual CSV construction.\n- Apply strict validation rules for all user-submitted fields that may end up in exported data.\n- Warn internal users handling CSV exports to open files with caution, preferably in tools that do not auto-execute formulas.\n- Consider exporting in non-executable formats (e.g., PDF) when appropriate for read-only reports.","ref_links":["[1] https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/CSV_Injection","[2] https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1236.html"],"created_by":"1c1c2c12-5368-44cc-a0af-4cc4e55e7e9c"},{"id":"028e8fe8-2a7c-4609-8b9a-c955c963d1eb","created_at":"2025-05-08T09:01:49.274Z","updated_at":"2025-05-30T16:36:22.795Z","title":"Insecure Session Management","background":"Insecure session management is a vulnerability that arises when applications fail to securely create, manage, and terminate user sessions. This can lead to session hijacking, fixation, or unauthorized access if session identifiers are predictable, inadequately protected, or improperly invalidated. Attackers exploiting this flaw can impersonate users, access sensitive information, or perform unauthorized actions within the application.","details":"During the penetration test, it was observed that the application's session management was not properly implemented, as demonstrated in the proof of concepts (PoCs) below. Attackers were able to reuse valid session tokens even after the user had successfully logged out, increasing the risk of session hijacking and unauthorized access.","remediation":"- Regenerate session identifiers after login, privilege escalation, or other sensitive operations to prevent session fixation.\n- Mark session cookies with the HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite=Strict attributes.\n- Ensure cookies are transmitted only over secure (HTTPS) connections.\n- Set idle and absolute timeouts for sessions to reduce the risk of hijacking.\n- Force users to re-authenticate after a defined period of inactivity.\n- Use Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens to protect session integrity.\n- Use securely generated, random, and sufficiently long session identifiers to prevent brute-force attacks.\n- Provide users with a logout feature that fully invalidates the session on the server.\n- Ensure proper cleanup of server-side session data upon logout.","ref_links":["[1] https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-top-10/2014-risks/m9-improper-session-handling","[2] https://help.fluidattacks.com/portal/en/kb/articles/criteria-vulnerabilities-076"],"created_by":"1c1c2c12-5368-44cc-a0af-4cc4e55e7e9c"},{"id":"1b76750a-6ac0-4ff7-84f7-2309bdd16f44","created_at":"2025-05-08T09:01:49.274Z","updated_at":"2025-05-30T19:38:53.673Z","title":"Clickjacking","background":"Clickjacking is a web security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker tricks users into clicking on elements of a website without their knowledge. By embedding a legitimate web page inside an invisible or opaque iframe, attackers can overlay it with misleading content. This exploit can lead to unintended actions, such as changing user settings, initiating unauthorized transactions, or even compromising sensitive information.","details":"During the penetration test, it was observed that the application is vulnerable to clickjacking, as demonstrated in the proof of concept (PoC) below. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to perform social engineering attacks, potentially tricking users into performing unintended actions on the application.","remediation":"- Configure the HTTP header X-Frame-Options to DENY or SAMEORIGIN to prevent your site from being embedded in iframes on unauthorized domains.\n- Use CSP frame-ancestors directive to explicitly specify which domains are allowed to embed your content.\n- Ensure that critical actions require explicit user interactions, such as multi-step confirmations or reauthentication.\n- Implement JavaScript-based frame-busting techniques to detect and prevent your content from being loaded in iframes.","ref_links":["[1] https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/clickjacking/","[2] https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/cybersecurity-fundamentals/threats/clickjacking.html"],"created_by":"1c1c2c12-5368-44cc-a0af-4cc4e55e7e9c"},{"id":"8d5d9181-4e9d-43e4-bc97-bfc08ccf66e7","created_at":"2025-05-08T09:01:49.274Z","updated_at":"2025-06-01T01:54:47.198Z","title":"Improper Authorization","background":"Improper authorization occurs when an application fails to adequately verify whether a user has the necessary permissions to perform a specific action or access a resource. This flaw can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, functionality, or administrative features. Improper authorization is commonly associated with broken access control vulnerabilities, such as IDOR, privilege escalation, or bypassing authorization mechanisms.","details":"During the penetration test, it was observed that some of the application's API endpoints do not properly implement authorization controls. As a result, attackers with low-level user privileges are able to access API endpoints that require higher levels of permission, as demonstrated in the proof of concept (PoC) below. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access to restricted functionality and sensitive data.","remediation":"- Define and enforce strict access control policies that specify which users or roles have permission to access specific resources and perform particular actions.\n- Ensure that the system performs proper authorization checks for every request to access resources or execute actions, verifying that the user has the appropriate permissions.\n- Assign users the minimum level of access necessary to perform their duties, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or actions.\n- Implement RBAC to manage permissions based on user roles, simplifying the assignment and management of access rights.\n- Keep detailed logs of access attempts and actions performed within the system.
